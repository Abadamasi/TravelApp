## 🧩 **Challenges & Solutions**

### 📌 **The Most Difficult Challenge**: Generating Downloadable Tickets
#### **Situation**
Travel websites often provide users with downloadable tickets, but integrating this feature dynamically with a backend system posed significant challenges. I needed to ensure ticket generation was fast, secure, and consistent in format.

#### **Task**
- Build a PDF generation service.
- Ensure tickets included user details, trip details, and a clean layout.

#### **Action**
- Implemented **PDFKit** for dynamic PDF generation on the server side.
- Designed a template system to organize ticket information.
- Added error handling and secure file download links.

#### **Result**
- Tickets are now generated dynamically and are available for users to download instantly in a professional format.
